# 2 -- Data Visualization

    Graph 1 -- Gamer's Habit
    US, Russia, China has the most populated concentrated players
    To consider to develop Steam online game in the US region as it is still a lightly tapped market
    
    Graph 2 -- Gamers Frequency per Location
    We suggest to include English, Russian, and Madarin as languages variations  to game development as US, Russia, and China, has the most populated concentrated players
    
    Graph 3 -- Games Frequency per Location
    Please consider to continue to develop Steam online game in the US region, a potential lightly tapped market. Even though the revenue growth is higher in Russia and China, we suggested the US region due to its consistent revenue growth with +7.3% growth on the year 2020, high spending power, and a leading game industry (as well as a profession).
